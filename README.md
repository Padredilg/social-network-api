## Description
This code provides the necessary Back-End for a social media in which users can be created, add each other as friends, share their thoughts, and also react to posts.

## Installation
To test this application on your local machine, you need to have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed in your computer first. </br>
Once that is taken care of, start by cloning this repo, run `npm init -y` and `npm i` to get the package.json files set up, then finally run the following command to get the necessary packages: `npm i mongoose express`

## Usage
Once the repo is cloned and packages are installed, start the application by running `npm start`, then test each route on a RESTful API Client such as Insomnia Core. </br></br>
